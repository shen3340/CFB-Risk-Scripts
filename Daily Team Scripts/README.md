There are two scripts here to help provide information for a team in a specific turn.
# Team Script
## MVP
A text file that outputs players who won MVP for the turn.
## Odds
An image that outputs the numerical odds of winning each territory, displaying which teams attacked/defended that territory.

## Legal Moves
A text file that outputs every single territory that your team is legally able to attack or defend, making it easier to upload orders from this text file. 
# Spreadsheet output
This script was specifically made for one of the users who uses a spreadsheet for their own analysis. It outputs cumulative statistics for each player on their team.
